# Python-Dictionary
taking idea from C++ project I have and making it in python with a gui for practice coding.


right now I can save words to a list that pops up on the right side with a scrollbar.

next steps:
save words for good (most likely in just a .txt file to start).
delete words.
actually have definitions pop up/saved.


long term:
be able to search for word matchup on dictionary.com + fill in definition from the website.
be able to multi-delete words in list.
