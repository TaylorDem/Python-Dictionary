# Python-Dictionary
taking idea from C++ project I have and making it in python with a gui for practice coding.


right now I can save words to a list that pops up on the right side with a scrollbar. 
delete them with a confirmation box and I am able to pull dictionary.com definitions using search button.

next steps:
save/delete words for good (most likely in just a .txt file to start).
have option to create custom definitions and save them.
create menu with commands like sort or change color


other goals:
be able to multi-delete words in list.
