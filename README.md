# Python-Dictionary
taking idea from C++ project I have and making it in python with a gui for practice coding.


right now I can save words to a list that pops up on the right side with a scrollbar. 
delete them with a confirmation box and I am able to pull dictionary.com definitions using search button.
list is alphabetized and doesn't contain duplicates.
current_dict.txt holds all the saved words.

next steps:
have option to create custom definitions and save them.
create menu with commands like sort type or change color themes.
have option to pull definition from urban dictionary instead/as well.\


make save random pull until ' ' character in textbox to save the random word displayed.


other quality of life goals:
be able to multi-delete words in list.
have error message change back to theme on next search.
